# Automatic-Image-Colorization
This project can colorize the grayscale image automatically. For this project used YUV color space. To colorize the image used two techniques: 1)Segmentation based coloring system and 2)Without segmentation based coloring system. For segmentation based coloring system, we used SLIC segmentation algorithm to segment the similar color region of the input image. Linear Regression and SVR algorithm used to predict the U and V channel. Furthermore, For without segmentation based coloring system. we used  a deep learning model(CNN).
